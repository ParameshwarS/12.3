1.Explain the uses of NoSQL Databases in brief and list the current NoSQL databases which are available.

It has a generic data model with Heterogeneous containers, including sets, maps, and arrays.
Data is stored in single tables as compared to joining multiple tables.
Adding more of the economical servers allows NoSQL databases to scale to handle more data.

Horizontal scaling is possible in  NoSql databases:
Distributed databases can store and process a set of information on more than one device.

When compared to relational databases, NoSQL databases are more scalable and provide superior performance.
Their data model addresses several issues that the relational model is not designed to address:

Types of Data that can be processed:
Large volumes of rapidly changing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

Agile sprints, quick schema iteration, and frequent code pushes
Object-oriented programming that is easy to use and flexible
Geographically distributed scale-out architecture instead of expensive, monolithic architecture

The Current NoSQL databases that are available are as follows:
MongoDB
Redis
Cassandra
CouchDB
HBase
Accumulo
Vertica

2.Explain the Differences between Hive and HBase in Brief with examples.

Hive is a query based language based on SQL which is useful to analyse data in the tables using HQL.
Hive queries are internally converted to mapreduce operations by the execution engine.
It doesnot provide row level update and delete operations.

While, HBase is actually a database(NoSQL) in hadoop that provides row level update and delete operations.
These databases can be queries using HBase shell commands.
It is partitioned to tables, and tables are further split into column families.
